<p class="">On my sixth birthday, I was very sick and rushed to the hospital and then I was sent to Sick Kids hospital in Toronto and was diagnosed with leukemia. With this diagnosis I was told that if I didn’t have a bone marrow transplant, I would not make it to my tenth birthday. After 3 years of treatment with chemotherapy and radiation, I was not getting any better, I received a phone call that would change my life and I received the bone marrow that I needed to beat leukemia.</p>
